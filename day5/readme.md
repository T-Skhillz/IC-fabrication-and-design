## Introduction

Day 5 of the Semiconductor Fabrication 101 course focused on **doping**, the process of adding impurities to silicon, and **ion implantation**, a precise method for controlling electrical properties in semiconductor devices. These processes are essential for creating p-type and n-type regions in transistors, which are the building blocks of integrated circuits.

## Doping and Diffusion

**Doping** introduces controlled amounts of impurities into silicon to change its conductivity. The two main types of dopants are:

- **n-type:** Adds electrons as charge carriers (e.g., phosphorus, arsenic)  
- **p-type:** Creates holes as charge carriers (e.g., boron)

**Diffusion** is a process in which dopants are thermally driven into the silicon lattice. It allows dopants to spread from a high concentration region into the desired areas of the wafer.

## Ion Implantation

Ion implantation is a more precise method for introducing dopants. High-energy ions are accelerated and implanted directly into the silicon substrate. Advantages of ion implantation include:

- Accurate control of dopant concentration and depth  
- Better repeatability compared to diffusion  
- Ability to form abrupt junctions essential for modern transistors

After implantation, the wafer undergoes **annealing**, a heat treatment that repairs crystal damage and activates the dopants.

## Importance in IC Fabrication

Doping and ion implantation define the electrical behavior of transistors:

- **Source and drain regions** in MOSFETs are formed using these techniques.  
- **Threshold voltage** and device performance depend on precise doping.  
- The layout must account for junction placement and spacing to ensure correct operation.

Without controlled doping, transistors would not function, and integrated circuits would fail.

## Conclusion

Day 5 emphasized that doping and ion implantation are critical steps in semiconductor fabrication. By modifying the electrical properties of silicon with precision, these processes enable the creation of functional transistors and integrated circuits. Understanding doping techniques is essential for IC design, layout, and reliable device manufacturing.
