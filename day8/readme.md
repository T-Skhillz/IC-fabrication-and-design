## Introduction

Day 8 of the Semiconductor Fabrication 101 course focused on the economic and industrial aspects of semiconductor manufacturing. The session examined how yield, cost, and large-scale production influence the design, fabrication, and availability of integrated circuits in the global technology industry.

## Manufacturing Yield

Yield refers to the percentage of functional chips obtained from a fabricated wafer. High yield is essential because semiconductor fabrication is expensive and complex.

Factors affecting yield include:

- Process defects and contamination  
- Photolithography alignment errors  
- Variations in deposition and etching  
- Design and layout quality  

Improving yield reduces waste and increases production efficiency.

## Cost of Semiconductor Fabrication

Semiconductor fabrication involves high capital investment in cleanrooms, equipment, and materials. The cost of manufacturing increases as device dimensions shrink and processes become more advanced.

Major contributors to cost include:

- Fabrication equipment and maintenance  
- Materials and chemical processing  
- Testing and packaging  
- Research and development  

Efficient design and process optimization are necessary to control manufacturing costs.

---

## Industry Overview

The semiconductor industry consists of different sectors such as:

- **Integrated Device Manufacturers (IDMs):** Companies that design and manufacture their own chips.  
- **Foundries:** Companies that fabricate chips designed by others.  
- **Fabless companies:** Firms that focus on design and outsource fabrication.  

This structure enables global collaboration in chip production and innovation.

## Relationship to IC Design and Layout

Yield and cost are strongly influenced by IC design and layout decisions. Designs that follow fabrication rules and minimize defects improve manufacturability and reduce production expenses. Therefore, engineers must consider economic and practical constraints alongside technical performance.

---

## Conclusion

Day 8 emphasized that semiconductor fabrication is not only a technical process but also an industrial and economic system. Yield optimization, cost control, and industry organization play critical roles in making integrated circuits widely available for modern technology. Understanding these factors provides a broader perspective on IC design and manufacturing.
