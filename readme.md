## Introduction

Day 2 of the Semiconductor Fabrication 101 course focused on the practical process of manufacturing integrated circuits and the importance of maintaining a cleanroom environment. The session explained how silicon wafers are transformed into functional electronic devices through a series of controlled fabrication steps.

## Silicon Wafer Preparation

The fabrication process begins with high-purity silicon wafers, which serve as the foundation for building electronic devices. The wafer surface must be extremely clean and smooth to allow accurate pattern transfer and layer formation.

## Major Fabrication Steps

The main steps involved in semiconductor fabrication include:

- **Deposition:** Adding thin layers of materials such as oxide or metal onto the wafer.
- **Photolithography:** Using light and photoresist to transfer circuit patterns onto the wafer.
- **Etching:** Removing unwanted materials to create circuit structures.
- **Doping (Ion Implantation):** Modifying the electrical properties of silicon by introducing impurities.
- **Metallization:** Creating metal interconnections between devices on the chip.

These steps are repeated multiple times to build complex integrated circuits layer by layer.

## Cleanroom Environment

A major lesson from Day 2 was the importance of cleanroom facilities in semiconductor fabrication. The fabrication process must take place in a controlled environment to prevent contamination by dust and particles.

Key cleanroom practices include:

- Use of protective clothing such as gowns, gloves, and masks.
- Controlled airflow, temperature, and humidity.
- Strict handling procedures for wafers and equipment.

Even microscopic contaminants can cause defects and reduce production yield.

## Importance of Process Control

Process control ensures consistency and accuracy throughout fabrication. Each step must be carefully monitored to maintain quality and device performance. Errors at any stage can lead to defective chips and increased manufacturing costs.

## Conclusion

Day 2 of the Semiconductor Fabrication 101 course highlighted the complexity and precision of semiconductor manufacturing. From wafer preparation to cleanroom practices, every stage plays a critical role in producing reliable and functional integrated circuits.
