## Introduction

Day 7 of the Semiconductor Fabrication 101 course focused on the final stages of integrated circuit manufacturing: testing, packaging, and reliability. These steps ensure that fabricated chips function correctly and can be safely used in electronic systems.

## Wafer Testing

Before chips are separated from the wafer, electrical tests are performed to verify their functionality. This process is known as **wafer probing** or **wafer testing**.

Key objectives of wafer testing include:

- Detecting defective circuits early.  
- Measuring electrical parameters such as voltage, current, and timing.  
- Improving overall manufacturing yield by identifying faulty dies.

Only chips that pass testing proceed to the packaging stage.

## Packaging Process

Packaging protects the integrated circuit and provides electrical connections to the external world. It involves placing the chip inside a protective case and attaching metal leads or pads for connection to circuit boards.

Functions of packaging include:

- Mechanical protection of the chip.  
- Heat dissipation.  
- Electrical interfacing with external systems.

Common packaging types include dual in-line packages (DIP), quad flat packages (QFP), and ball grid array (BGA).

## Reliability and Quality Control

Reliability testing ensures that integrated circuits can operate correctly over long periods under different conditions such as temperature, voltage, and stress.

Quality control processes include:

- Stress testing and burn-in testing.  
- Failure analysis to detect weak points in fabrication.  
- Monitoring yield and defect rates.

These procedures help manufacturers guarantee consistent performance and product safety.

## Importance to IC Design and Layout

Testing and packaging are closely related to IC design and layout. The layout must consider:

- Test points for electrical probing.  
- Pad placement for packaging connections.  
- Thermal and mechanical constraints.

Good design and layout improve testability, reliability, and manufacturing success.

## Conclusion

Day 7 emphasized that semiconductor fabrication does not end with device creation. Testing, packaging, and reliability analysis are critical steps that ensure integrated circuits are functional, durable, and ready for real-world applications. These final processes complete the journey from silicon wafer to usable electronic component.
