## Introduction

Day 9 of the Semiconductor Fabrication 101 course focused on the future of semiconductor technology, including device scaling, emerging fabrication techniques, and career opportunities in the semiconductor industry. The session highlighted how continuous innovation is required to meet the growing demand for faster, smaller, and more efficient electronic devices.

## Device Scaling and Moore’s Law

For several decades, semiconductor technology has followed Moore’s Law, which states that the number of transistors on a chip increases approximately every two years. Scaling allows circuits to become smaller, faster, and more power-efficient.

However, as device dimensions approach nanometer scales, physical limitations such as heat dissipation, leakage currents, and material constraints become significant challenges. These issues require new design approaches and fabrication methods.

## Emerging Technologies

The course discussed several emerging trends in semiconductor fabrication, including:

- **Advanced lithography techniques** such as extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography.  
- **New materials** to replace or supplement silicon for improved performance.  
- **Three-dimensional (3D) integration** and chip stacking to increase functionality without shrinking device size further.  

These innovations aim to overcome the limitations of traditional scaling.

## Impact on IC Design and Layout

Future fabrication technologies strongly influence IC design and layout. Designers must consider:

- Smaller feature sizes and tighter design rules.  
- Increased interconnect complexity.  
- Power efficiency and thermal management.  

Modern layout strategies must adapt to these challenges to ensure manufacturable and reliable circuits.
