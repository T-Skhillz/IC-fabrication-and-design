## Introduction

Day 4 of the Semiconductor Fabrication 101 course focused on two essential processes in integrated circuit manufacturing: deposition and etching. These processes are used to add and remove materials from the silicon wafer in order to form the physical structures of electronic devices.

## Deposition Process

Deposition is the method of adding thin layers of material onto the surface of a silicon wafer. These layers may include oxides, nitrides, polysilicon, and metals. Deposition allows precise control of layer thickness and material properties.

Common deposition techniques include:

- **Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD):** Uses chemical reactions to form thin films on the wafer.
- **Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD):** Uses physical methods such as sputtering to deposit materials.
- **Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD):** Deposits material one atomic layer at a time for high precision.

Deposition is critical for creating insulating, conducting, and semiconducting layers in IC fabrication.

## Etching Process

Etching is the process of removing unwanted material from the wafer surface after patterning through photolithography. It transfers the pattern from the photoresist into the underlying material layers.

Two main types of etching were discussed:

- **Wet Etching:** Uses liquid chemicals to dissolve materials selectively.
- **Dry Etching (Plasma Etching):** Uses plasma to remove material with higher precision and better control.

Dry etching is preferred for modern integrated circuits due to its ability to produce fine and vertical features.

## Selectivity and Uniformity

An important concept learned in Day 4 was selectivity, which refers to the ability of an etching process to remove one material while leaving others unaffected. Uniformity ensures that material removal or deposition occurs evenly across the wafer surface.

Both selectivity and uniformity are critical for achieving reliable device performance and high manufacturing yield.

## Role in IC Design and Layout

Deposition and etching directly impact IC layout because they determine the final physical dimensions of circuit features. Layout designs must account for these processes to ensure that fabricated structures match the intended design.

---

## Conclusion

Day 4 of the Semiconductor Fabrication 101 course demonstrated that deposition and etching are fundamental to building integrated circuits. These processes allow materials to be added and removed with precision, enabling the formation of transistors and interconnections. Understanding these techniques is essential for studying IC design, layout, and semiconductor manufacturing.
