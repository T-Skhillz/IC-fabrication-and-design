## Introduction

Day 6 of the Semiconductor Fabrication 101 course focused on **metallization** and **interconnects**, which are essential for connecting transistors and forming functional integrated circuits. This stage completes the physical realization of circuits on silicon wafers and ensures that the IC operates as intended.

## Metallization Process

Metallization involves depositing conductive layers (typically aluminum or copper) onto the wafer to form interconnections between devices. These metal layers allow current to flow between transistors, resistors, and capacitors.

Common metallization techniques include:

- **Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD):** Sputtering metal onto the wafer.  
- **Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD):** Using chemical reactions to deposit thin conductive films.  

Multiple layers of metal may be deposited and patterned to create complex routing for advanced integrated circuits.

## Interconnects

Interconnects are the metal paths that connect various components on the chip. Key aspects include:

- **Via formation:** Creating vertical connections between metal layers.  
- **Routing:** Connecting transistors and other devices according to the layout.  
- **Planarization:** Ensuring a flat surface for subsequent layers using Chemical Mechanical Polishing (CMP).  

Proper interconnect design is critical to reduce resistance, capacitance, and signal delay, ensuring the chip performs reliably.

## Role in IC Fabrication and Layout

Metallization and interconnects translate the logical design into a physical, working chip. The IC layout must plan for:

- Metal layer placement  
- Via locations  
- Layer alignment and spacing  

These factors affect device performance, signal integrity, and manufacturing yield.

## Conclusion

Day 6 emphasized that metallization and interconnects are the final critical steps in semiconductor fabrication. They connect individual devices into a complete circuit, allowing integrated circuits to function as designed. Understanding this process is essential for anyone studying IC design, layout, or semiconductor manufacturing.
