## Introduction

Day 3 of the Semiconductor Fabrication 101 course focused on photolithography and pattern transfer, which are core processes in integrated circuit manufacturing. Photolithography enables the precise definition of circuit patterns on silicon wafers and determines the physical structure of transistors and interconnections.

## Concept of Photolithography

Photolithography is a process used to transfer geometric patterns from a photomask onto a silicon wafer using light. A light-sensitive material called photoresist is applied to the wafer surface. When exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light through a mask, specific regions of the photoresist are altered and developed to reveal the desired pattern.

This patterned photoresist serves as a protective layer for subsequent fabrication steps such as etching or doping.

## Photomasks and Their Role

A photomask contains the circuit pattern that will be projected onto the wafer. It acts as a template that defines where materials will be added or removed during fabrication.

Key functions of photomasks include:
- Defining transistor regions and interconnections.
- Ensuring accuracy and repeatability of circuit patterns.
- Enabling the creation of complex multilayer structures.

## Photoresist Types

Two main types of photoresist were discussed:

- **Positive photoresist:** Exposed areas become soluble and are removed during development.
- **Negative photoresist:** Exposed areas harden and remain after development.

The choice of photoresist affects resolution, accuracy, and processing conditions.

## Alignment and Resolution

Accurate alignment between successive layers is critical in photolithography. Misalignment can lead to defective circuits and reduced yield. Resolution determines the smallest feature size that can be printed on the wafer and directly impacts device performance and scaling.

Modern fabrication relies on advanced optical systems to achieve nanometer-scale patterning.

## Importance of Photolithography in IC Manufacturing

Photolithography is one of the most important steps in semiconductor fabrication because it controls the geometry of every device on the chip. Errors in this step can affect the entire manufacturing process and result in faulty integrated circuits.

This process is repeated many times during fabrication to create multiple layers of transistors and metal interconnections.

## Conclusion

Day 3 of the Semiconductor Fabrication 101 course emphasized that photolithography is the foundation of pattern formation in semiconductor manufacturing. Through the use of photomasks, photoresist, and precise alignment, complex integrated circuits can be fabricated with high accuracy and reliability. Understanding this process is essential for studying IC design and layout.
